# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-Across-College-Majors

This project continues on from my [previous project](https://github.com/EJMpanduki/Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors) where we visualized earnings based on college majors.

In this we investigate whether or not there is a gender gap in college majors and how it has been changing from 1970 to 2012. I also took the opportunity to generate decluttered visualizations as well as using colors that are color-blind friendly.
